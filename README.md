-  This project was my high school project which was completed with the help of my mentor and my group members.
-  For microcontroller we used ATmega16 and the codes are in C language. 

- We decided to make a 4 motor robot instead of 3 motor robot, because with 4 motors we could have more direction (8 main direction and 8 sub directions). Also we could have more fource for moving forward.

- We used 16 TSOP sensors to follow the ball, but for selecting one of the sensors to send data, a multiplexer was used.

- For the robot to know where the goal is, a compass was used.
